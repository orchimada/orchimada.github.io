# a personal website using GitHub Pages and Airtables

Basically, these are several iframes embeds from [Airtable](https://airtable.com), that allows to store evertything (notes, links, music) on one URL for convenience.

The idea was to make a super simple pseudo-CMS. How does it work? I've got several specific [Shortcuts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8) on my devices that bookmark interesting links in the form I need (with a note, image, shortened URL, saved to a specific table etc) using Airtable API. Once this is done the table I chose to show on my website is automatically updated. No coding, no wordpress, no writing frontend - just plain html, css, and a bit of js.

Thanks for checking it out!
