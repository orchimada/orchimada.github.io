# a personal website using GitHub Pages and Airtables

Basically, it's a wrapper for several iframes (Airtables, Apple Music), that allows to store evertything on one URL for convenience.

The best part is CMS, which is Airtables API + Shortcuts. This allows me to save a link/image/quote when I'm on mobile using SHortcut with a simple POST request to Airtable API or edit a "new post" right in the Airtables app, add a comment and other info into my private log and it will appear on the website. Super fast, super simple.

Thanks for checking it out!
